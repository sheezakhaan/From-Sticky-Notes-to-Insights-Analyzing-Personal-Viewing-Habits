# Analyzing-Viewing-Patterns-Shows-and-Movies
The project aimed to investigate a surprising discovery: a collection of sticky notes with names of various movies and TV shows. These notes had been compiled in response to requests for viewing recommendations. While cleaning a drawer, this collection was stumbled upon coincidentally during a period of learning about data analysis. The discovery sparked curiosity about the substantial number of shows and movies consumed. The project sought to uncover the sources of time for such extensive viewing, the content that was consumed, and the means by which this extensive viewing was achieved.
