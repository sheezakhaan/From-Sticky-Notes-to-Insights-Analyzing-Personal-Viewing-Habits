# From Sticky Notes to Insights: Analyzing Personal Viewing Habits
The project began with an unexpected discovery: a stack of sticky notes listing movies and TV shows I had watched and recommended over time. I found them while cleaning out a drawer during a period when I was learning data analysis, and the collection sparked a deeper investigation. I took the opportunity and turned this informal archive into a structured dataset to explore patterns in my viewing habitsâ€”what I watched, when I watched it, and how such a large volume of content fit into my schedule. The project combines personal curiosity with practical data analysis techniques.
